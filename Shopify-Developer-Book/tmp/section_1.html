<p>Being a software developer for the Shopify platform is a great way to work with computing skills currently in demand and to pay the bills. E-Commerce is seeing explosive growth and there are constantly new markets evolving. Working on Shopify merchant sites and App projects and your email inbox fills with letters like this: &#8220;Just thought you&#8217;d like to know Shopify sent you $148.00 USD&#8221; or &#8220;FizzBuzz.com just sent you $2622.50 USD with PayPal&#8221;. That should inspire the effort to learn the API and programming patterns for e-commerce! It is a great way to earn <em>passive</em> income that you can combine with working for merchants to make <em>active</em> income. It&#8217;s a career and can be the basis for a successful business, and offers up a wide range of interesting opportunities. Specializing on theme development is rewarding financially for those with design flair and skills. App development and making custom scripts for merchant shops is my favorite. It offers the challenges of using cloud computing, networking, database development, connecting to API driven services like social media and many others. It is great when code you&#8217;ve written helps a merchant increase their sales 20% overnight! I sincerely hope that developers considering work on Shopify projects read this and get inspired to work on making the next great merchant shop or App. I have worked with and for hundreds of happy merchants and they continue to tell me how happy they are with the Shopify platform.</p>

<h3 id='preface'>Preface</h3>

<p>I like to think that I don&#8217;t really mark time with much enthusiasm or rigour. When I began my professional career developing code to non-destructively test steel bridges for structural integrity, I marked off eight years before I sensed I had done enough crazy climbing and driving and that I needed a break. I spent a good five years around the dotcom bubble renting a nice office with good friends trying to make web apps. Then I spent five more years taking on a variety of consulting gigs that in the end never amounted to a hill of beans but taught me how to wear many various business hats. I picked up the Shopify bug and tried working with a boutique web agency. As five more years passed, I realized that I knew a lot about being an independent computer business, and that I knew a lot about tricking out Shopify for an ever growing list of clients. I have yet to give myself an official work title, nor have I declared my intentions or loyalty to any one type of computing and my Corporation is pretty much a sad sack but expensive accounting exercise I leave to those who get a kick out that kind of thing. I am sure it&#8217;s going to reach a decade in age as neglected as my vinyl collection. One needs a corporation though to run off invoices and interact with clients in foreign nations, so I go along with that. Dividends anyone?</p>

<p>A beautiful autumn day in Montreal and Shopify came for a visit with their CTO Cody, Joey Devilla on the Accordion and Edward the king of the API, with much swag and the company credit cards to cover the beer bill. We owe that to Meeech who organized it all and attracted a small but curious crowd of locals to hear more about Shopify. I decided at that time to pitch this effort, an eBook written from the perspective of a developer with a lot of experience working on Shopify, but not working for Shopify. Over the years my nom de plume of Hunkybill on the Shopify public forums wrote many words on many subjects and I endured the gamut possible responses over time. My all time favorite is still <em>Plonk</em> as that one word continues to tickle my funny bone. If a couple of thousand Hunkybill posts survive on some hard drive in some data center for a few more years that is one thing, but I was pretty sure I wanted to create something a little more structered and formal.</p>

<h3 id='acknowledgements'>Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>First an foremost I want to say a big thank you to Shopify for supporting this effort through the Shopify fund. Over the years I expended energy and time recommending Shopify to all comers but at the same time, I can see that I was also critical and not always a perfect gentleman in my writing. Instead of ignoring me and my pitch however, Shopify chose to sweep aside some of the lower points from the past. Taking the high road and for that I am grateful.</p>

<p>To all the developers and designers that I have interacted with I owe a hearty thanks to as well. Some fine people have come and gone from the Shopify community over the years and I do respect the fact that a lot of their contributions remain useful and just as valid today as they were five years ago. It is very inspiring to have witnessed how one Caroline Schnapp jumped into the Shopify community, starting off with some simple scripting work to make shops better until ultimately she was so valuable to Shopify they hired her! My thanks to Caroline for sharing with me her wisdom about how Shopify really works and for always correcting me when my forum posts are clearly sour or plain wrong. I mean no harm to anyone and I am trying hard to avoid controversy these days.</p>

<p>I also with to thank Tobi from Shopify for his numerous great contributions to open source software like Liquid and Delayed Job. Programmers always learn by studying what other successful programmers have done and I must admit that I have learned many good things from his code. Thanks to Jesse Storimer for sharing his eBook tools with me and his code. His original Shopify API Sinatra application was the inspiration that moved me to develop an App for myself and today I have over 500 installed Apps all based of off Sinatra running well in the cloud thanks to Heroku! The best developer friendly cloud platform has to be Heroku. Thanks also to Cody, Edward, Joey and Harley for the hospitality when I trucked on down the 417 to Ottawa for a visit to the new office. Very swell place to work and I am sure the entire gang that works there have one of the better workplaces in all of Canada to go to on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Thanks to my wife and kids for putting up with a guy who likes to sit in the corner all day and poke away at a keyboard instead of doing something heroic like flying space shuttles or putting out forest fires or saving baby seals from being clubbed. I try to be exciting for you but I just can&#8217;t seem to find the right chords.</p>

<h3 id='who_is_this_ebook_for'>Who is this eBook For?</h3>

<p>Everyone that is interested in Shopify&#8230;</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>If you know nothing about Shopify, this book will provide some information about how it all works. Perhaps enough to inspire someone to go the next step and do some real research.</p>

<p>If you know a little something about Shopify, this book will probably teach you at least one thing you probably did not know.</p>

<p>If you want to develop Apps for Shopify, or build a theme for someone, this book may shed some light on the particulars of doing that.</p>

<h3 id='what_is_assumed_by_the_author'>What is Assumed by the Author</h3>

<p>Nothing. Assumptions are almost always wrong. This is no written attempt to coddle anyone on the path to mastering some specific aspect of Shopify. This book is <em>not</em> a &#8220;Learn Shopify in 7 minutes, 7 hours, or 7 days&#8221; recipe book. There is no attempt to put into words any of the magic spells, incantations or dangerous chemistry that goes into the workaday world of a professional Shopify coder.</p>

<h3 id='about_the_author'>About the Author</h3>

<p>My engineering career started professionally in 1990 at about the same the World Wide Web was invented with the introduction of HTTP protocol for the Internet. Before the use of HTTP was common the Internet was mainly used to exchange email (using SMTP), to post messages and have discussions on Usenet (using NNTP) or transferring binary and text files between clients and servers (using FTP). Archie, Veronica and Gopher were other interesting choices to use for searching documents. Once the Internet concept jumped across the early adopter chasm to be embraced by the dotcom businesses and general population, a flurry of changes ensued. Nortel had ramped up to make the Internet as fast and capable as is it today (and ironically crashed in the resulting process) and throngs of business people sitting on the sidelines with few clues about what to do with this vast network poured money into the foundations of what are today some of the most valuable business properties in the world.</p>

<p>1998 was the year I transitioned my software development focus from R&amp;D C and C++ development to Internet Computing. I recognized that one could craft very efficient programs with much less code using dynamic scripting languages, like Ruby, Python and PHP. If it took 25 lines of Java or C++ to put a button on the screen, Ruby or Tcl/Tk did it in one line. I was hooked on that concept.</p>

<p>The early commercial Internet was all about established software titans showing off their chops. Coding for the web involved Microsoft ASP, Visual Studio and SQL Server to deliver web applications running on hugely energy inefficient Compaq Proliant servers. Other quirky technologies like Cold Fusion were often used too. Many friends and collegues have done what I have and hung out a shingle as an Internet computing engineer. Need a web enabled CRM? I can write you one. Need to manage your freight forwarding logistics company on the web? I can make you a web app for that. Need a website to sell flowers online? I can make you one. Need to send 50,000 emails to your world-wide employees? Got that covered. You have to interface to an EDI system with an AS/400 legacy database and a transactional web site? Let&#8217;s do it. Ariba XML catalog to a SMB web site with an XML catalog of business pens and office equipment? Sure why not.</p>

<p>In the early years of running your own business as a software engineering consultant or freelance programmer you, like me, will inevitably experience the pain of working capital shortages. You&#8217;ll collect a cadre of loyal clients with small or tiny budgets. You cannot easily sell them anything from Microsoft, Oracle or most other enterprise technology companies. Try presenting a license acquisition cost of $22,000 for a database server for your SMB client. The world of proprietary and expensive software pushed me to drop all that and adopt Open Source Software as my toolkit. I started developing using Linux as my operating system, PHP as my server-side scripting language, and PostgreSQL as my database.</p>

<p>Ignoring Perl as a web app scripting language and adopting the new kid on the block PHP meant building out a CMS was best done with Drupal and E-Commerce for the masses with OSCommerce. There was very little Ruby or Python code for these endeavors so I hunkered down to try and fill my toolbox with the best tools that did not totally suck. Yahoo came out with their brilliant YUI framework and I jumped on that immediately for the nice documentation and functionalities it provided. Soon after a software developer named Jack Slocum came along and decided to extend YUI into his own vision of a framework. He called his version YUI-ext and quickly attracted a small but loyal following. His vision was to provide Grids (like excel), and Trees (like Windows explorer or Mac OS Finder), and dialog boxes, and toolbars and most of the widgets that we take for granted today but that were rare indeed back then. Eventually that code matured into it&#8217;s own product called ExtJS that today is perhaps better known as Sencha. Shopify was born at about this period of time in my timeline. Just as Ruby on Rails was becoming the new kid on the block.</p>

<p>PHP and Javascript were constantly evolving as were web browsers. As Microsoft oddly chose to stagnate with their now infamously bad IE web browser, Mozilla, Safari and Opera continued to extend web browser capabilities enough so that we could see realized the vision of web applications with enough sophistication to justify comparing them to native applications. Tools like Firebug and the Firefox browser, combined with Ajax (ironically a huge thanks to Microsoft for asynchronous Javascript) and the Ruby language offering introspection into a running Web App, developers now had something really hot to work with.</p>

<h3 id='finding_shopify_what_a_relief'>Finding Shopify, What a Relief!</h3>

<p>Shopify was being developed and released as a Beta service. I signed up as soon as the Beta was available, knowing I would be able to offer e-commerce to my clients, without having to hack PHP OSCommerce again. If you have never examined OSCommerce code, you are somewhat lucky. It was at best a spaghetti western in terms of code. Plus Shopify offered a hosted service, eliminating worries about security, backups and system administration tasks. Having to maintain my own Linux and Windows servers in a co-location facility over many years provided me with ample opportunities to freak out with the responsibilities of system administration tasks. How to SSH tunnel between boxes? How to best freak out when hard drives failed? How can RAID can be a source of mirror images of garbage? How come hackers keep trying for years to break into my puny systems? How lousy is it to have to patch/upgrade services like Apache, PHP, Postfix, etc? Answer! Very much a lousy thing, at least for me. There is nothing like finding out a client&#8217;s SSL certificate has expired, and I cannot exchange it for a new one without the password for the old one that is long forgotten and lost due to neglect. There is nothing quite like finding out the database has been failing to record certain entries for a few weeks due to a memory corruption bug.</p>

<p>Shopify to the rescue! Hosted E-Commerce! No more headaches! Simple templating with Liquid, ability to do any Javascript I want! That is the pattern that works for me. Should work for almost anyone.</p>
