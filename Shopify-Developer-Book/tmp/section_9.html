      <h2 id='how_to_handle_webhook_requests'>How to Handle Webhook Requests</h2>

<p>This is a big important topic. If Shopify doesn&#8217;t receive a 200 OK status response within 10 seconds of sending a WebHook, Shopify will assume there is a problem and will mark it as a failed attempt. Repeated attempts will be made for up to 48 hours. Too many failures and the WebHook is deleted. A common cause for failure is an App that performs too much complex processing when it receives request before responding. When processing WebHooks a quick 200 OK response that acknowledges receipt of the data is essential.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some pseudocode demonstrating what I mean:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre>def handle_webhook request
  process_data request.data    # Note that the process_data call could take a lot of time, perhaps 2-6 seconds
  status 200
end
</pre>
</div>
<p>To make sure that you don&#8217;t take too long before responding you should defer processing the WebHook data until <em>after</em> the response has been sent. Delayed or background jobs are perfect for this.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how your code could look:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre>def handle_webhook request
  schedule_processing request.data    # this takes no time so the response is quick
  status 200
end
</pre>
</div>
<p>Even if you&#8217;re only doing a small amount of processing there are other factors to take into account. On-demand cloud services such as Heroku or PHPFog will need to spin up a new processing node to handle sporadic requests since they often put Apps to sleep when they are not busy. This can take several seconds. If your App is only spending five seconds processing data it will still <em>fail</em> if the underlying server took five seconds to start up.</p>

<h3 id='the_interesting_world_of_webhooks'>The Interesting World of WebHooks</h3>

<p>Shopify does a fine job of introducing and explaining WebHooks on the wiki, and there are some pretty nifty use cases provided. The <em>best practices</em> are essential reading and should be thoroughly understood to get the most out of using WebHooks. There are all sorts of interesting issues with WebHooks.</p>

<p><a href='http://wiki.shopify.com/WebHook#How_Should_I_Handle_Webhook_Requests'>Shopify WebHooks Documentation</a></p>

<p>When you are dealing with Shopify Webhooks you are in the Email &amp; Preferences section of a shop. You can setup a WebHook using the web interface. Pick the type of WebHook you want to use and provide a URL that will be receiving the data. For those without an App to hook up to a shop there are some nifty WebHook testing sites available that are free to use. Let&#8217;s take one quick example and use RequestBin. The first thing to do is create a WebHook listener at the <a href='http://requestb.in/' title='RequestBin'>Request Bin</a> website.</p>
<div class='figure'>
  <img alt='Create a new RequestBin for your WebHook' src='../images/request_bin_home2.png' />
</div>
<p>Pressing the <em>Create a RequestBin</em> button creates a new WebHook listener. The result is a generated URL that can be used for testing. Note that one can also make this test private so that only you can see the results of WebHooks sent to the RequestBin.</p>
<div class='figure'>
  <img alt='Newly Created RequestBin' src='../images/request_bin_created2.png' />
</div>
<p>The RequestBin listener is the URL that can be copied into the Shopify Webhook creation form at the shop&#8217;s Email &amp; Preferences administration section. http://www.postbin.org/155tzv2 where the code <strong>155tzv2</strong> was generated just for this test. Using the WebHook create form one can pick the type of WebHook to test and specify where to send it.</p>
<div class='figure'>
  <img alt='WebHook Created in Shopify Email and Preferences' src='../images/webhook_created2.png' />
</div>
<p>When the WebHook has been created you can send it to the RequestBin service any time by clicking on the <strong>send test notification</strong> link and standing by for a confirmation that it was indeed sent.</p>
<div class='figure'>
  <img alt='Testable WebHook' src='../images/webhook_testable2.png' />
</div>
<p>The links to delete a WebHook as well as test are beside each other. Exercise some caution when click in this neighborhood! It is easy to accidentally press the trashcan icon and remove a WebHook that should <em>never be removed</em>. Ooops! It can take only seconds of carelessness to decouple a shop from a crucial App.</p>

<p>Sending a test is easy, and the result should be immediately available in RequestBin. The example shows a test order in JSON format.</p>
<div class='figure'>
  <img alt='WebHook Results' src='../images/webhook_results2.png' />
</div>
<p>Looking closely at the sample order data which is in JSON format there is a complete order to work with. The loop is loop is closed on the concept of creating, testing and capturing WebHooks. The listener at RequestBin is a surrogate for a real one that would exist in an App but it can prove useful as a development tool.</p>

<p>For the discussion of WebHook testing note that the sample data from Shopify is good for testing connectivity but not so much for testing an App. Close examination of the provided data shows a lot of the fields are empty or null. It would be nice to be able send real data to an App without the hassle of actually using the shop and booking orders. A real scenario might be to test and establish:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ensure the WebHook order data actually came from Shopify, and that you have the source shop correctly identified.</li>

<li>Ensure there is not already an identical order as it makes no sense to process a <em>PAID</em> order two or more times.</li>

<li>Parsing out the credit card used, and the shipping charges, and the discount codes used if any is needed.</li>

<li>Parsing out any product customization data in the cart note or cart attributes.</li>
</ol>

<p>This small list introduces some issues that may not be obvious to new developers to the Shopify platform. Addressing each one will provide some useful insight into how to structure an App to deal with real WebHooks from Shopify.</p>

<h3 id='webhook_validation'>WebHook Validation</h3>

<p>When setting up an App in the Shopify Partner web application the key attributes generated by Shopify for the App is the authentication data. Every App has an API key to identify it as well as a shared secret. These are unique tokens and they are critical to providing a secure exchange of data between Apps and Shopify. In the case of validating the source of a WebHook, both Shopify and the App can use the shared secret. When you use the API to install a WebHook into a Shop, Shopify knows the identity of the App requesting the WebHook to be created, so Shopify uses the shared secret associated with the App and makes it part of the WebHook itself. Before Shopify sends off a WebHook created by an App it will be use the shared secret to compute a Hash of the WebHook payload and embed this in the WebHook&#8217;s HTTP headers. Any WebHook from Shopify that has been setup with the API will have HTTP_X_SHOPIFY_HMAC_SHA256 in the HTTP request header. Since the App has access to the shared secret it can use that to decode the incoming request. The Shopify team provides some working code for this.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre>SHARED_SECRET = &quot;f10ad00c67b72550854a34dc166d9161&quot;
def verify_webhook(data, hmac_header)
  digest  = OpenSSL::Digest::Digest.new(&#39;sha256&#39;)
  hmac    = Base64.encode64(OpenSSL::HMAC.digest(digest, SHARED_SECRET, data)).strip
  hmac == hmac_header
end
</pre>
</div>
<p>The App calculates a value only it could know. The header provides a value from Shopify If the two computed values match, it is assured the WebHook is valid and came from Shopify. That is why it is important to ensure the shared secret is not widely distrubuted on the Internet.</p>

<h3 id='looking_out_for_duplicate_webhooks'>Looking out for Duplicate Webhooks</h3>

<p>As explained in the WebHook best practices guide, Shopify will send a WebHook out and then wait up to ten seconds for a response status. If that response is not received the WebHook will be resent. This continues until a 200 OK status is received ensuring that even if a network connection is down or some other problem is present Shopify will keep trying to get the WebHook to the App. The initial interval between retries of ten seconds is not practical for a large number of retries so the time interval between requests is constantly extended until the WebHook is only retried every hour or more. If nothing changes within 48 hours an email is sent to the App owner warning them their WebHook receiver is not working and that the WebHook itself will be deleted from the shop. This can have harsh consequences, mitigated by the fact that the email should be sufficient to alert the App owner to the existence of a problem.</p>

<p>Assuming all is well with the network and the App is receiving WebHooks it is entirely possible that an App will receive the odd duplicate WebHook. Shopify is originating WebHook requests in a Data Center and there are certainly going to be hops through various Internet routers as the WebHook traverses various links to your App. If you use the tracert command to examine these hops you can see the latency or time it takes for each hop. Sometimes, an overloaded router in the path will take a long time to forward the needed data extending the time it takes for a complete exchange between Shopify and an App. Sometimes the App itself can take a long time to process a WebHook and respond. In any case a duplicate is possible and the App might have a problem unless it deals with the possibility of duplicates.</p>

<p>A simple way to deal with this might be to have the App record the ID of the incoming WebHook resource. For example, on a paid order if the App knows apriori that order 123456 is already processed, any further orders detected with the ID 123456 can be ignored. Turns out in practice this is not a robust solution. A busy shop can inundate an App with orders/paid WebHooks and at any moment no matter how efficient the App is at processing those incoming WebHooks, there can be enough latency to ensure Shopify sends a duplicate order out.</p>

<p>A robust way to handle WebHooks is to put in place a Message Queue (MQ) service. All incoming WebHooks should be directed to a message queue. Once an incoming WebHook is successfully added to the queue the App simply returns the 200 Status OK response to Shopify and the WebHook is completed. If that process is subject to network latency or other issues it makes no difference as the queue welcomes any and all WebHooks, duplicates or not.</p>

<p>The App has a queue worker process used to <em>pop</em> WebHooks from the queue for processing. There is no longer a concern over processing speed and the App can do all the sophisticated processing it needs to do. It is possible to be certain whether a WebHook has been processed already or not. Duplicated WebHooks are best taken care of with this kind of architecture.</p>

<h3 id='parsing_webhooks'>Parsing WebHooks</h3>

<p>Shopify provides WebHook requests as XML or JSON. Most scripting languages have XML and JSON parsers to make request processing easy. With the advent of NoSQL databases, storing JSON as documents in CouchDB or MongoDB is possible. It is also easy to use Node.js on the server to process WebHooks where JSON is a natural fit. Since the logic of searching a request for a specific field is the same for both formats, it is up to the App author to choose the format they prefer.</p>

<h3 id='cart_customization'>Cart Customization</h3>

<p>Without a doubt one of the most useful but also a more difficult aspect of front end Shopify development is in the use of the cart note and cart attribute features. They are the only way a shop can collect non-standard information from a customer. Any monogrammed handbags, initialed wedding invitations, engraved glass baby bottles etc. will have used the cart note or cart attributes to capture this information and pass it through the order process. Since a cart note or cart attribute is just a key and value, the value is restricted to a string. A string could be a simple name like &#8220;Bob&#8221; or it could conceivably be a sophisticated Javascript Object like &#8221;<span>{&#8220;name&#8221;: &#8220;Joe Blow&#8221;, &#8220;age&#8221; : &#8220;29&#8221;, &#8220;dob&#8221;: &#8220;1958-01-29&#8221;},{&#8220;name&#8221;: &#8220;Henrietta Booger&#8221;, &#8220;age&#8221; : &#8220;19&#8221;, &#8220;dob&#8221;: &#8220;1978-05-21&#8221;},..{&#8220;name&#8221;: &#8220;Psilly Psilon&#8221;, &#8220;age&#8221; : &#8220;39&#8221;, &#8220;dob&#8221;: &#8220;1968-06-03&#8221;}</span>&#8221;. In the App, when parsing cart attributes with JSON, it is possible to reconstitute the original object embedded there. This pattern of augmenting orders with cart attributes, passing them to Apps by WebHook for processing has made it possible for the Shopify platform to deliver a wide variety of sites with unique features.</p>
