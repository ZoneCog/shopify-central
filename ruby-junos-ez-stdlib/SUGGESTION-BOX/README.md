# PLEASE CONTRIBUTE

## IDEAS & SUGGESTIONS

If you have a suggestion or idea, please write it up as a separate file and do a *pull request*.  Your file will be added to this directory as a separate file so folks can peer-review and crowdsource around it.  

It would be helpful to include the following information in the file:

1. SYNOPSIS - A brief statement of what is needed
2. TARGET PLATFORMS - A list of Junos OS based platforms this would apply to
3. TARGET RELEASE - If you have specific Junos OS release requirements, please state them
4. TIMELINE - If you have a specific *gotta have it* by date, please let us know
5. GORY DETAILS - Please provide as much information you can around the use-case or application

Please name your file in the following format:

    <DATEYYMMDD>_<GITHUB-USER-HANDLE>_<IDEA-NAME>.md

For example, let's say I was going to submit something around virtual-routing (VRF), I would name the file:

    20130430_jeremyschulman_vrf.md
