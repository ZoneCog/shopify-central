## Reporting a Bug

Think you've found a bug or have a new feature to suggest? Let us know!

1. Update to the most recent master release if possible. We may have already fixed your bug.

2. Search for similar issues. It's possible somebody has encountered this bug already.

3. Please make sure you provide very specific steps to reproduce the error. If we cannot reproduce
it, we will close the ticket.

4. If possible, submit a Pull Request with a failing test. Better yet, take a stab at fixing the bug
yourself if you can!

The more information you provide, the easier it is for us to validate that there is a bug and the
faster we'll be able to take action.

## Requesting a Feature

1. Search Issues for similar feature requests. It's possible somebody has already asked for this
feature or provided a pull request that we're still discussing.

2. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature you want and why it's important to add.
Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a
small subset.

3. If the feature is complex, consider writing some initial documentation for it. If we do end up
accepting the feature it will need to be documented and this will also help us to understand it
better ourselves.

4. Attempt a Pull Request. If you're at all able, start writing some code. We always have more work
to do than time to do it. If you can write some code then that will speed the process along.

## Code Changes

When opening a PR, please include the following:

1. Keep code changes simple. Always ask, "Is the code as simple as I can make it?"

2. Explain what the change does and why it is needed.

3. Write tests for your code
