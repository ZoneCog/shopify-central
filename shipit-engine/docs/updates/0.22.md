# 0.22 Upgrade guide

Starting from `0.22`, Shipit uses the new [GitHub Apps API](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/),
this requires older installations to go through the setup process again.

To do so you can follow the [setup guide for new installations](../setup.md), **but with one key difference**, you must keep the the old API token under `github_api.token`.

If you don't Shipit won't be able to garbage collect the webhooks it used to setup on repos.
