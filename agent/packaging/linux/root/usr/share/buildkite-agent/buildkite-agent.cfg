# Path to the bootstrap script. You should avoid changing this file as it will
# be overridden when you update your agent. If you need to make changes to this
# file: use the hooks provided, or copy the file and reference it here.

# DEPRECATION: As of v3 we've removed the shell version of bootstrap.sh file.
# We've re-written it in Go so we can have better cross-platform support, and
# add new features such as plugin support - which is much harder to write in
# bash. You can still use your own custom bootstrap-script now, and that feature
# will stick around for v3.x, so if you need to use it, just uncommment the line
# below :)
