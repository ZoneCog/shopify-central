## Tools and frameworks

* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is our preprocessor of choice
* [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) for its [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) plugin
* [stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint) is our preferred linter for `SCSS`'.  See our custom [linting rules](https://github.com/Shopify/stylelint-config-shopify)
* [SassDoc](https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc) is our preferred form of documentation

## Philosophy and structure

We strive to write modular, component driven CSS that is reusable and has a clear separation of concerns. We want an accessible codebase that makes it easy for both newcomers and old-hands to understand, navigate, and change features.

1. Reusable components first
2. Page specific only as a last resort
