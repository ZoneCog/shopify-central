# DESCRIPTION

ZFS - recipes for installing and enabling, resources for managing.

Currently lacks any kind of pool management, so you'll have to create this yourself.


## RECIPES

Right now, the default recipe will just install and enable ZFS on Ubuntu-based systems.

## RESOURCES

The `zfs` resource will assist with creating filesystems. See `resources/zfs.rb` for a list
of properties supported.
