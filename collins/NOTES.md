Use alchemist to determine what to do based on serial

Options:
+ Passthrough to bios
+ Send alchemy to prepare server based on specified action sets
 + Initial intake
 + Burnin tasks
 + Other

Alchemist should read almost everything from collins

Need to input existing server serial numbers:
+ dmidecode -s system-serial-number # gives system serial number

Need to get a better deploy procedure
+ Fuck you capistrano

Need to change "IP to IP\_ADDRESS" everywhere

Find where we have IPMI but no actual ipmi data, fix these

Delete IPMI attribute eventually
