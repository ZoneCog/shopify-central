 * All vals and vars in a case class are considered columns, whether they are or not. If you need one, make it private.
 * Make sure your ID is part of the case class constructor otherwise the copy method won't carry over the value
 * Make sure you call toList and not toSeq on find operations or you'll get weird errors. toSeq is lazily evaluated which doesn't work well with some jdbc drivers
