RE: Notification of Claimed Infringement Our file: 01977-26

Dear Mr. Rochon:

As required under Sections 512(c)(3) and 512(d)(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §§ 512(c)(3), 512(d)(3), I have been instructed and authorized by the intellectual property rights owner, Fitness Anywhere LLC, to place you on notice of images constituting copyright and trademark infringement accessible at the following two stores being operated through Shopify API: WWW.THAFITNESSFACTORY.COM (IP: 204.93.213.41).

The below-referenced infringing content is hosted on servers owned by Server Central Networks. In lieu of requesting a direct takedown of this infringing content by that ISP, and thereby possibly interfering with your hosting of bona fide content and services utilized by other customers, I am requesting that you take immediate action to disable access to this infringing content and storefronts utilizing the Shopify API.

We believe that the hosting of such copyright and trademark infringing content is also in violation of the Shopify Terms of Service. Specifically, the “Account Terms” of the Shopify service require that a user “may not use the Shopify service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose nor may you, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright laws) as well as the laws of Canada and the Province of Ontario.”

The content currently being hosted and publicly disseminated through your Shopify API through the above-referenced storefronts infringe both Canadian and United States copyright and trademark laws and your Terms of Service as identified here. To the extent that Shopify has stated its clear intention that “Don’t use Shopify for anything illegal or transmit any harmful code. Remember that with any violation of these terms we will cancel your service,” we are respectfully requesting that you take immediate action to cancel the Shopify API services for the above-referenced infringing storefronts.

Products offered for sale through the below–referenced URL are counterfeit replica of products made by the intellectual property rights owner Fitness Anywhere. In addition, as explained below all of the advertising images, as well as trademarks, appearing on the referenced URLs are unauthorized copies of works owned by Fitness Anywhere. The URL hosting infringing content being served through Shopify are as follows:
