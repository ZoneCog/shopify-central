Re: Infringement of “Sin Bin Hockey” Trademark

To Whom It May Concern,

It has been brought to my attention that a customer of yours is operating the ecommerce website sinbinhockeyco.com and has been using the trademark “Sin Bin Hockey” in association with the marketing or sale of products and services. Please be advised that “Sin Bin Hockey” is a registered trademark (U.S. Reg. No.4264056).

This letter is official notification under the provisions of Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") to effect removal of the above-reported infringements. I request that you immediately issue a cancellation message as specified in RFC 1036 for the specified postings and prevent the infringer, who is identified by its Web address, from posting the infringing material to your servers in the future. Please be advised that law requires you, as a service provider, to "expeditiously remove or disable access to" the infringing material upon receiving this notice. Noncompliance may result in a loss of immunity for liability under the DMCA.

I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of here is not authorized by me, the trademark holder, or the law. The information provided here is accurate to the best of my knowledge. I swear under penalty of perjury that I am the trademark holder.

Please send me at the address noted below a prompt response indicating the actions you have taken to resolve this matter.

Sincerely,
