A versioned copy of Lua tests
=============================

Tests for the Lua VM exist as a series of tar.gz files at http://www.lua.org/tests/.

This repository tracks those files as versioned releases. It is intended to provide a test suite for [go-lua](https://github.com/Shopify/go-lua). To that end, the https://github.com/Shopify/lua-tests/tree/go-lua branch exists to remove or modify test cases to workaround go-lua limitations.
