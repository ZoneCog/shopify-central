When proposing changes/additions to the Ruby style guide:

* Consider the best practices and rules recommended by the
  [Ruby Community Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).

* Style guide rules should always lead to better readability, consistency and
  code quality. Avoid enforcing personal preferences that don't contribute with
  any of these.

* If you have any questions or need feedback, feel free to hit up
  \#ruby-style-guide on Slack.
