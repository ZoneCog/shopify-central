# SassC::Rails [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bolandrm/sassc-rails.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/bolandrm/sassc-rails) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sassc-rails.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/sassc-rails)

We all love working with Sass, but compilation can take quite a long time for larger
codebases.  This gem integrates the C implementation of Sass,
[LibSass](https://github.com/sass/libsass), into the asset pipeline.

In one larger project, this made compilation 4x faster:

```
# Using sassc-rails

[1] pry(main)> Benchmark.bm { |bm| bm.report { Rails.application.assets["application.css"] } }
       user     system      total        real
   1.720000   0.170000   1.890000 (  1.936867)

# Using sass-rails

 [1] pry(main)> Benchmark.bm { |bm| bm.report { Rails.application.assets["application.css"] } }
       user     system      total        real
  7.820000   0.250000   8.070000 (  8.106347)
```

This should essentially be a drop in alternative to [sass-rails](https://github.com/rails/sass-rails).

__Note:  This is a new project, please report any issues you come across!__

## Inline Source Maps

With SassC-Rails, it's also extremely easy to turn on inline source maps. Simply
add the following configuration to your development.rb file:

```ruby
# config/environments/development.rb
config.sass.inline_source_maps = true
```

After adding this config line, you may need to clear your assets cache
(`rm -r tmp/cache/assets`), stop spring, and restart your rails server.

Note, as indicated, these source maps are *inline*.  They will not generate additional
files or anything like that.  Instead, they will be appended to the compiled
application.css file.

## LibSass Compatibility With Ruby Sass

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sassc-rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Common Issues

### Deployment to Heroku

Due to LibSass compilation requirements, you must upgrade to the
[Heroku Cedar-14 Stack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cedar-14-migration)
in order to successfully install this gem.

Upgrading to Cedar-14 is usually a painless process.


### Installing alongside a gem that depends on Sass-Rails

Libraries explicitly depending on Sass-Rails, such as ActiveAdmin, can cause
conflicts with installation of SassC-Rails.  While we have no built-in solution
for this, please check out [this issue](https://github.com/bolandrm/sassc-rails/issues/6)
for a workaround.

## Changelog

- **1.0.0**
