# analytics.js-integrations

This repository has been *deprecated*. Each integration has been split into an individual repository and moved to the [segment-integrations organization][]; for example, the Google Analytics integration has been moved to <https://github.com/segment-integrations/analytics.js-integration-google-analytics>.

If you're an existing user and are here to open an issue against an integration, head over to the [segment-integrations organization][] and open an issue on that integration's repository, or email <mailto:friends@segment.com> for help if you're not sure where to start.

If you're a new partner and are interested in integrating with Segment, check out our [Partners page](https://segment.com/partners/) for more details and to submit an application.
