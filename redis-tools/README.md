# redis-tools

A small collection of tools to help monitor your Redis server.

## redistamp

Very tight client that connects to your server and stores the current date in a `redistamp` key every second.  When used in a replicated environment, this allows you to easily check for replication lag.

## Ruby tools

These use the `redis` and `hiredis` gems, and install these via the `bundler` gem.  By default, they install their gems into `tools/gems`; you can `cd` to tools and `bundle exec ./tool.rb` to run them.

Output is in JSON format, for easy integration with log monitoring solutions like Splunk.

### redis-slowlog

Monitors the Redis slow query log and outputs any new entries it sees.

### redis-usage

Traverses the Redis keyspace via `SCAN` and outputs guesstimates on memory usage.  It assumes that you use a colon-separated key hierarchy, e.g. "foo:bar:baz"; if a key lacks any colons, it will try separating it by dashes and underscores instead.

If any tree node gets too leafy, it will prune it and just keep stats rather than filling up memory with all the sub-key names; for example, if you have 100,000 keys like `a:*` and only 50 keys like `b:*`, you'll see the usage of each individual `b:*` key, but the `a:*` keys will be rolled up into a single size for `a`.  (This happens at any level except the root, so if you have too many unique root-level prefixes, you may use a lot of memory and get a lot of output.)

Since this puts a lot of load on Redis, it's meant to be run on a readonly slave rather than the master database, and will abort otherwise.
