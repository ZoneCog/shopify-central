# ecfg(5) -- JSON, YAML, or TOML file with asymmetric-key-encrypted values

## SYNOPSIS

An `ecfg` file is syntactically a `json`, `yaml`, or `toml`
file, but with a few minor semantic additions described below.

## PUBLIC KEY

Each `ecfg` file must have a key at the top level named
`_public_key`. This implies that the top-level structure must be a
hashmap, not an array.

The `_public_key` key must have a string value, which is a hex-encoded
32-byte (totalling 64 ASCII bytes) public key as generated by
ecfg-keygen(1).

By convention, `_public_key` should be the first key in the file.

## ENCRYPTABLE VALUES

A value is considered encryptable if:

1. It is a string literal (numbers, true, false, null all remain unencrypted);

2. It is not an object key (ie. not immediately followed by a ":" in JSON,
   etc.);

3. Its corresponding object key did not begin with an underscore ("\_").

Take special note of point 3. This is the reason `_public_key` isn't
encrypted, and can be used to construct metadata schemes. For example, in the
excerpt below, only the values for `rotation_password` and `secret` will
be encrypted.

```json
"my_secret": {
  "_description": "API key for foocorp",
  "_rotation": "https://example.com/foocorp/apikey",
  "_rotation_username": "admin",
  "rotation_password": "password",
  "secret": "123123123123123123123"
}
```

Also note that this underscore "unencryptable" attribute is not heritable. For
example, the password in this excerpt `will` be encrypted.

```json
"_unencryptable": {
  "password": "encrypted anyway"
}
```

## SECRET SCHEMA

When a value is encrypted, it will be replaced by a relatively long string of
the form *"EJ[V:P:N:M]"*. The fields are:

* `V` (decimal-as-string int)
Schema Version, hard-coded to "1" for now

* `P` (base64-encoded 32-byte array)
Public key of an ephemeral keypair used to encrypt this key

* `N` (base64-encoded 24-byte array)
Nonce used to encrypt this key

* `M` (base64-encoded variable-length array)
Raw ciphertext

## ENCRYPTION ALGORITHMS

`ecfg` values are encrypted using a Curve25519 x Salsa20 x Poly1305-AES
public-key scheme. This normally implies use of `NaCl` or `libsodium`.

NaCl libraries generally take keys as a sequence of raw bytes, but they're
embedded in ecfg files as hex-encoded strings, so we need a routine to convert
them:

```
base16_to_raw(key : string) -> []byte =
  # convert e.g. "1234beef" into [0x12, 0x34, 0xBE, 0xEF] or whatever
  # the particular NaCl implementation/binding wants.
```

When we write the final encrypted message according to the `SECRET SCHEMA`
section, we need to encode several sequences of raw bytes to base64, with
newlines removed:

```
encode(raw : []byte) -> string =
  sub("\n", "", base64_encode(raw))
```

Building the message given the ciphertext and other input parameters is just
string concatenation:

```
format(pub : []byte, nonce : []byte, ct : []byte) -> string =
  "EJ[1:" + encode(pub) + ":" + encode(nonce) + ":" + encode(ct) + "]"
```

During encryption, an ephemeral keypair is generated and the public key is
embedded in the encrypted message.

The final encryption routine combines accepts a plaintext string and a
hex-encoded public key extracted from the input document, returning a formatted
`ecfg` message. The NaCl API calls here are loosely paraphrased.

```
encrypt(plaintext : string, peer_pub_hex : string) -> string =
  peer_pub = base16_to_raw(peer_pub_hex)

  (ephemeral_pub, ephemeral_priv) = NACL.crypto_box_keypair()

  # 24 random bytes
  nonce = NACL.randombytes(NACL.NONCE_BYTES)

  # API here varies a lot depending on binding.
  ciphertext = NACL.crypto_box(
    plaintext,
    ephemeral_priv, peer_pub, nonce
  )

  format(ephemeral_pub, nonce, ciphertext)
```

If multiple values are being encrypted at once, a single ephemeral keypair may
be reused. It may make sense but is by no means necessary to use box
precomputation if it's available.

## DECRYPTION ALGORITHMS

To decrypt messages from a document, the caller must first retrieve the private
key associated to the public key embedded in the document, then the message
must be decomposed into the three encoded values. This is just the inverse of
the process from the encryption section above: remove the "EJ[]" enclosure;
split the message on ":", check that the version is 1, then base64-decode the
remaining three components.

Given those three components (`peer_pubkey`, `nonce`, and `ciphertext`), the
decryption routine looks like:

```
decrypt(
  target_privkey : string,
  peer_pubkey    : []byte,
  nonce          : []byte,
  ciphertext     : []byte,
) -> string =
  priv = base16_to_raw(target_privkey)

  # like above, this API varies a lot by binding implementation.
  NACL.crypto_box_open(
    priv, peer_pubkey, nonce, ciphertext
  )
```
